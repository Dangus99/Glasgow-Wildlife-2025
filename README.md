# Rat Racer App
- All of the code is teams and [github](https://github.com/Dangus99/Glasgow-Wildlife-2025) and to summaries:
	- The code is written in python using a library called [dash]([Dash Documentation & User Guide | Plotly](https://dash.plotly.com/)).
	- You can run the app as a script using the `app.py` or you can run as jupyter notebook using the `rat-racer.ipynb`
	- `requirements.txt` contains all the libraries to run the code.
	- `rankings.csv` contains the data that the code converts to a table. The data is structured with 3 columns:
		- Rank: which position is racer in the leader board.
		- Racer: name of the racer.
		- Time: the time it took to racer to complete the maze. Formatted m:ss.ms example: 1m 09s 7 ms. I used this app to time to racer: [Webscorer | Race registration, race timing, race results](https://www.webscorer.com/)
- The website is hosted on [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)
